# Vercel Deployment Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Runtime Version Error**: The original error "Function Runtimes must have a valid version" was caused by:
   - vercel.json pointing to `api/index.js` instead of `api/index.ts`
   - Using incorrect runtime configuration

2. **Module System Mismatch**: The API file was using CommonJS (`require`) but the project is configured as ESM (`"type": "module"`)

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated vercel.json
- Changed from `api/index.js` to `api/index.ts`
- Updated runtime to `nodejs18.x`
- Added proper rewrites configuration

### 2. Updated API file
- Changed from CommonJS to ESM syntax
- Updated import statements to use ESM

### 3. Build Configuration
- The build process creates `dist/index.js` which is correctly referenced

## Deployment Steps

1. **Push changes to your repository**
2. **Connect your repository to Vercel**
3. **Deploy** - Vercel should automatically detect the configuration

## Environment Variables (if needed)
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `PORT=5000` (Vercel will override this)

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:
1. Check that all TypeScript files compile correctly
2. Ensure all dependencies are installed
3. Verify the build output structure
